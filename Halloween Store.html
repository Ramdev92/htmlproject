<h2>Welcome to my site. Please come in and stay awhile.</h2>
<p>I started this web site beacause Halloween has always been my favorite holiday. But during the last year, I started selling some of 
my favorite Halloween products, and they've become quite a hit.</p>

I will keep you up-to-date on all things Halloween.</p>
<h2>Product Categories</h2>

<li>Props</li>
<li>Costumes</li>
<li>Special Effects</li>
<li>Masks</li>
</ul>
<h3>My guarantee</h3>
<p>If you aren't completely satisfied with everything you buy from my site, you can return it for a full refund. <b>No questions asked!</b></p>
